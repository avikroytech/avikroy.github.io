  // About Section - Enhanced version of your blurb
  aboutMe: "I'm a builder at heart—someone who's been writing code since age 8 and never stopped asking \"what if?\" My journey into software engineering wasn't conventional; I'm largely self-taught, learning through disciplined online courses, late-night experiments, and countless iterations. What drives me is the challenge of turning abstract ideas into tangible solutions that solve real problems. Whether it's architecting a full-stack e-commerce platform, developing Unity games with complex AI systems, or building AI-powered applications, I thrive on breaking down complex challenges and shipping products that create genuine impact. Currently a sophomore at Tesla STEM High School, I'm both AWS and Azure certified, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges that push the boundaries of what I can build.",
